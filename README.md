# Circle the Cat Solver ðŸ˜¸
Interactive, reinforcement-learning based solver for the game Circle the Cat. Includes an implementation of the game. Frontend written in React, and reinforcement learning provided by a lightly modified REINFORCEjs by Andrej Karpathy.

# Usage
For now, you'll have to run this code locally to play around with the solver. Future updates will change that.

Clone the repo,
```
$ git clone https://github.com/anishpdoshi/circle_the_cat_solver.git
$ cd circle_the_cat
```
...install dependencies,
```bash
$ npm install
```
...start the server,
```bash
$ node index.js
````
...and you're good to go! Navigate to `localhost:8080` to start solving circle the cat!
